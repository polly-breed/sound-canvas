# Sound Canvas - Interactive Digital Music Score

This is an interactive web-based application where users can draw on a canvas using six different colors. Each color corresponds to a unique sound sample, and the position of the drawing on the canvas affects the volume and playback timing of the sound.

## Features

- Six color options: Black, Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Magenta
- Vertical positioning affects volume (0% to 200%)
- Horizontal positioning affects timing (up to 60 seconds)
- Playhead moves from left to right, reading the drawing as a music score
- Buttons for play, pause, stop, and clear

## Usage

- Select a color by clicking one of the color buttons.
- Draw on the canvas.
- Use the play, pause, and stop buttons to control playback.
- Click the clear button to clear the canvas.
